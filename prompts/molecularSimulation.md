Create a p5.js simulation in HTML that visualizes molecular bonding and thermal motion
The simulation should:

Represent atoms as colored circles with different properties
Include force-based interactions to simulate bonding
Feature a temperature control to adjust thermal motion
Visualize bonds between atoms when they're close enough
Allow users to adjust bond strength and number of atoms
Create a physics-based system where:

Atoms repel when too close (electron cloud repulsion)
Atoms attract at optimal bonding distances
Different atom types have different bonding affinities
Temperature increases random motion


Include interactive controls for users to experiment with
Provide visual feedback on bond formation through line thickness and opacity
Create a clean, intuitive interface with explanatory information
