Create an interactive web-based particle animation using P5.js with the following features:
Display 200 particles with random sizes and positions on a dark background

Particles should move with random velocities and wrap around the screen edges

Connect nearby particles (within 100 pixels) with semi-transparent lines

Implement a color system using HSB mode with cycling hues that change over time

Add a fading trail effect using a semi-transparent background

Make particles responsive to mouse interaction:
Spawn new particles when the mouse is clicked

Attract particles toward the mouse position when pressed

Give particles a limited lifespan, after which they reset to a new random position

Include subtle random movement and velocity dampening for natural motion

Make the canvas responsive to window resizing

Add a glowing effect to particles with brightness based on distance from the mouse
