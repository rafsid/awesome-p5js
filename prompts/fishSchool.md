Create a P5.js simulation of fish schooling behavior with the following specifications:
Simulate a school of 300 fish swimming in a coordinated pattern while avoiding the edges of the window.

Implement the three classic flocking behaviors:
Alignment - Fish steer towards the average direction of their neighbors.

Cohesion - Fish steer towards the average position of their neighbors.

Separation - Fish avoid crowding each other.

Add additional features:
Edge avoidance - Fish detect when theyâ€™re approaching the edges of the 'aquarium' and steer away.

Varying fish sizes and colors - For a more natural look, give fish random sizes and pastel colors (e.g., shades of pink, purple, blue, and green).

Underwater effect - Include visual elements like bubbles, light rays, and a gradient background transitioning from dark blue at the top to lighter blue at the bottom to simulate an underwater environment.

Ensure the simulation is visually appealing, with fish forming dynamic, flowing patterns similar to a natural school, and include subtle animations for bubbles and light rays to enhance the underwater atmosphere.
