Use javascript to create an animation of falling letters with realistic physics. The letters should:
* Appear randomly at the top of the screen with varying sizes
* Fall under Earth's gravity (9.8 m/sÂ²)
* Have collision detection based on their actual letter shapes
* Interact with other letters, ground, and screen boundaries
* Have density properties similar to water
* Dynamically adapt to screen size changes
* Display on a dark background

All the code needs to be in a single HTML file that I can run. Also run the code
